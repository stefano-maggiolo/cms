class FileAPIMiddleware(object):
    """A RESTful HTTP API to access and alter files in the storage.

    This WSGI application tries to port the FileCacher interface to
    HTTP. It focuses more on the backend storage features (i.e. the
    get_file*, put_file*, describe and delete methods) rather than on
    the caching abilities (i.e. load, save, drop, purge_cache and
    destroy_cache methods), in that it provides only the former ones.

    Being RESTful, each file is an entity with an URL in the form
    "/<digest>", which supports GET and DELETE methods (with obvious
    meaning). The description is available at "/<digest>/description".
    PUT and PATCH aren't supported because by changing the content of
    the file its digest changes too, effectively creating a new file.
    New files can be created with a POST request to "/". The URL of the
    newly created file (from which the digest can be extracted) is put
    in the Location header of the response.

    The body of GET responses will always contain the file's content
    verbatim. The same is expected for PUT requests. Descriptions will
    be UTF8-encoded text/plain resources.

    The MIME type of files isn't stored. This means that we'll ignore
    the Content-Type of incoming files and that we will use
    "application/octet-stream" for served files.

    The filename isn't stored either but, since browser clients benefit
    from Content-Disposition: attachment headers that declare the
    filename, the client can request such a header with a "filename"
    query parameter (e.g. "/abcdef?filename=foo.cpp").
