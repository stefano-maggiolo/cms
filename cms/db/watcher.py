    """Provide notifications of changes in the database.

    Using PostgreSQL's asynchronous notification capabilities (i.e. the
    NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN queries), instantiated with appropriate
    triggers and callback functions (installed by init_db), be notified
    when a row gets inserted, updated or deleted. In case of an update
    receive also the exact list of column whose values changed.

    There's a channel for each entity type and for each event type. Its
    name is in the form "{event_type}_{table_name}" (event_type can be
    "create", "update" or "delete"). The payload is composed by a first
    line containing the ID as space-separated integers. In case of an
    "update" event, successive lines (each separated by just a newline,
    '\\n') contain the names of the modified columns.

    Events can be received only when there's an active connection. Even
    if we reconnect immediately after a connection loss there's no way
    we can discover if we missed some notifications, or even get them!
    Therefore each time we establish a new connection (after attaching
    to all channels again) we tell everybody interested that they have
    to reinitialize their internal status.

    The intended workflow for a Watcher is to instantiate one, give it
    all the init callbacks, call the listen method as needed and then
    execute the run method inside a greenlet. All the callbacks will
    be spawned inside dedicated greenlets too.
